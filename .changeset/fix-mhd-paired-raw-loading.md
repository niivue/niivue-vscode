Fix MHD files loading as a black image. MHD is a detached format where voxel data lives in a separate `.raw` file referenced by `ElementDataFile` in the header. NiiVue's URL-based loader does not auto-detect the paired `.raw` URL for MHD files, so the extension now parses the header, resolves the raw file URI, and passes it to the webview as `urlImgData` (URL path) or `pairedData` (binary-data path). The webview forwards `urlImgData` to NiiVue's `loadImages` call and uses a Blob URL to load `pairedData` when binary buffers are provided.
